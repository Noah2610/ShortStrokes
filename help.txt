ShortStrokes
  by Noah Rosenzweig

  A simple shortcut script using vim-like keystrokes.
  Written in Ruby using the Curses library.

INSTALLATION
  Run
    $ git clone https://github.com/Noah2610/ShortStrokes.git
  and have Ruby (probably like 2.0 or up)
  and ruby-bundler installed, then just run
    $ bundle install
  in the root of the project and after that
  you should be able to run
    $ ./ShortStrokes.rb
  without any issues.

USAGE
  The basic usage of this script is to bind it to a keyboard shortcut
  and define your desired keybindings as shell script
  in a keybindings YAML file.
  After you have entered text inside the program,
  use the escape key to clear it or to exit the script when the input is empty.

CONFIGURATION
  This script looks for a keybindings/config (yaml) file
  in the following order / locations:
    - ~/.config/shortstrokes/keybindings.yml
    - ~/.shortstrokes.yml
    - \<PROJECT-ROOT\>/keybindings.yml
  This is overwritten when using the --config option.
  A default config file is included with the project
  in ./keybindings.yml.

ARGUMENTS / OPTIONS
  -h, --help           Show help text, basically this README
  -v, --version        Show version
  -c, --config FILE    Use keybindings config file FILE (yaml)
  -f, --force          Ignore error when using --config with a file
                       without a .yml or .yaml extension
